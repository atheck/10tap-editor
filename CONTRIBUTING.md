## Development workflow

This project is a monorepo managed using [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/using-npm/workspaces). It contains the following packages:

- The library package in the root directory.
- An example app in the `examplelatest/` directory.

To get started with the project, install all dependencies in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

The [example app](/examplelatest/) demonstrates usage of the library. You need to run it to test any changes you make.

It is configured to use the local version of the library, so any changes you make to the library's source code will be reflected in the example app. Changes to the library's JavaScript code will be reflected in the example app without a rebuild, but native code changes will require a rebuild of the example app.

If you want to use Android Studio or XCode to edit the native code, you can open the `examplelatest/android` or `examplelatest/ios` directories respectively in those editors. To edit the Objective-C or Swift files, open `examplelatest/ios/examplelatest.xcworkspace` in XCode and find the source files at `Pods > Development Pods > tentap`.

To edit the Java or Kotlin files, open `examplelatest/android` in Android studio and find the source files at `tentap` under `Android`.

You can use various commands from the root directory to work with the project.

Before running the examples you must build the editor
To build the editor:

```sh
npm run editor:build
```

If you are working on the web side of the editor and you want to have hot reload enabled you need to do the following

1. run `npm run editor:dev`
2. inside `useEditorBridge` set `DEV: true`

```tsx
const editor = useEditorBridge({
  DEV: true,
  DEV_SERVER_URL: 'http://locahost:1234', // (OPTIONAL) - if the dev server is running on a different port
});
```

To start the packager:

```sh
npm -w tentap-example-latest run start
```

To run the example app on Android:

```sh
npm -w tentap-example-latest run android
```

To run the example app on iOS:

```sh
npm -w tentap-example-latest run ios
```

By default, the example is configured to build with the old architecture. To run the example with the new architecture, you can do the following:

1. For Android, run:

   ```sh
   ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_newArchEnabled=true npm -w tentap-example-latest run android
   ```

2. For iOS, run:

   ```sh
   RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 npx pod-install examplelatest/ios
   npm -w tentap-example-latest run ios
   ```

If you are building for a different architecture than your previous build, make sure to remove the build folders first. You can run the following command to cleanup all build folders:

```sh
npm run clean
```

To confirm that the app is running with the new architecture, you can check the Metro logs for a message like this:

```sh
Running "tentap-example-latest" with {"fabric":true,"initialProps":{"concurrentRoot":true},"rootTag":1}
```

Note the `"fabric":true` and `"concurrentRoot":true` properties.

Make sure your code passes TypeScript and ESLint. Run the following to verify:

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

To fix formatting errors, run the following:

```sh
npm run lint -- --fix
```

### Commit message convention

We follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) for our commit messages:

- `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix crash due to deprecated method.
- `feat`: new features, e.g. add new method to the module.
- `refactor`: code refactor, e.g. migrate from class components to hooks.
- `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for the module..
- `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change CI config.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.

### Linting

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting the code.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that the linter passes when committing.

### Publishing to npm

We use [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to make it easier to publish new versions. It handles common tasks like bumping version based on semver, creating tags and releases etc.

To publish new versions, run the following:

```sh
npm run release
```

### Scripts

The `package.json` file contains various scripts for common tasks:

- `npm install`: setup project by installing dependencies.
- `npm run editor:build`: build the editor
- `npm run editor:dev`: run the editor dev server
- `npm run typecheck`: type-check files with TypeScript.
- `npm run lint`: lint files with ESLint.
- `npm -w tentap-example-latest run start`: start the Metro server for the example app.
- `npm -w tentap-example-latest run android`: run the example app on Android.
- `npm -w tentap-example-latest run ios`: run the example app on iOS.

### Sending a pull request

> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

When you're sending a pull request:

- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
- Verify that linters are passing.
- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.
- Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.
- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.
